target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.systematicmoney.org/systematic-trading">Systematic
Trading: A unique new method for designing trading and investing
systems</a>》 is a comprehensive guide for traders and investors seeking
a structured approach to the markets.</p>
<p>Aimed at both novices and experienced traders, the book offers
practical insights and applications, making it a pretty good resource
for anyone looking to enhance their trading methodology with a
systematic approach.</p>
<p>This is not a book totally about automating trading strategies. It’s
possible to trade systematically using an entirely manual process with
just a spreadsheet to speed up calculations, so automation is not
necessary, the key word if "systematic". This passage mainly covers the
first two chapters, providing a rough overview of this book. Hope you
can enjoy it</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<h1 id="flawed-human-brain">Flawed Human Brain</h1>
<h2 id="three-types-of-traders">Three types of traders</h2>
<p>There are three types of traders in this book. To a certain extent,
these three types are determined and classified by the degree of
automation with which they execute transactions.</p>
<p><strong>1. asset allocating investor</strong></p>
<p>Asset allocators can use systematic methods to avoid the short-term
chasing of fads and fashions that they know will reduce their returns.
They might be lazy and wise amateur investors, or managing institutional
portfolios with long horizons such as pension funds.</p>
<p>Asset allocators are sceptical about those who claim to get extra
returns from frequent trading. For this reason <strong>the basic asset
allocation principle assumes you can’t forecast how asset prices will
perform</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2. semi-automatic trader</strong></p>
<p>Semi-automatic traders think they are superior to simple rules when
it comes to forecasting by how much prices will go up or down; instead
they make their own educated guesses</p>
<p>They would like to <strong>place those bets inside a systematic
framework which will ensure their positions and risk are properly
managed</strong>. This frees them up to spend more time making the right
call on the market.</p>
<p><strong>3. staunch systems trader</strong></p>
<p>The staunch systems trader is a true believer in the benefits of
fully systematic trading. Unlike the semi-automatic trader and the asset
allocating investor, they embrace the use of systematic trading rules to
forecast price changes, but within the same common framework for
position risk management.</p>
<h2 id="avoid-mistake-instead-of-silver-bullet">Avoid mistake instead of
silver bullet</h2>
<p>This book claims that there is no magic system that will
automatically make huge profits for you, and you should be wary of
anyone who says otherwise, especially if they want to sell it to
you.</p>
<p>Instead, <strong>success in systematic trading is mostly down to
avoiding common mistakes</strong> such as over complicating your system,
being too optimistic about likely returns, taking excessive risks, and
trading too often.</p>
<p>The aim of this book isn’t just to offer a single predefined system
for trading, but to provide a modular framework which can be adapted to
meet your needs. Part three describes the framework in detail. Just like
you can choose different engines and tyres on a car, my framework
includes options for different trading rules and position sizing
calculations.</p>
<h2 id="overconfidence-leads-to-flawed-human-brain">Overconfidence leads
to flawed human brain</h2>
<p>Meddling is due to the biggest cognitive bias of all:
<strong>overconfidence</strong>. We think we are cleverer than the
trading system and we are. To stop meddling with our trading systems we
require what economists call a <strong>commitment
mechanism</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a purely objective system</strong> is a powerful
commitment mechanism.</p>
<p>A highly subjective rule would be something like ‘Sell for small
losses, and hold on to large profit making positions’.</p>
<p>Another advantage of objective systems is that they can be automated,
and automation is a good commitment mechanism</p>
<p>But automation doesn’t stop meddling, having a system which requires
a human to do the actual execution of automatically generated trades is
still prone to meddling, so it must be done with a <strong>well designed
system</strong> in which you have full confidence.</p>
<p>One simple principle is systems whose performance and behaviour can
be explained will be more preferred, while there are <strong>some
pitfalls to avoid when designing trading systems: over-fitting,
overtrading and over-betting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>over-fitting</li>
</ul>
<p>If we’re not careful the rules selected will fit the data too well.
They will be highly tuned to one set of market conditions and perform
worse in actual trading than a simpler rule would.</p>
<ul>
<li>overtrading</li>
</ul>
<p>Both amateur investors and professional managers have a tendency to
trade too frequently.There are extra costs involved in trading more
often.</p>
<p>Overtrading suggests overconfidence in your own relative ability to
overcome the higher hurdle of bigger costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>over-betting</li>
</ul>
<p>If your confidence is unbounded you can bet the maximum that your
broker allows you to. Potentially this could be a ten-fold leverage on
an individual equity bet, equating to an annual standard deviation of
returns of around 200%.</p>
<h1 id="systematic-trading-rules">Systematic Trading Rules</h1>
<p>This section mostly relates to how trading rules are fitted. This is
less applicable to asset allocating investors and semi-automatic
traders</p>
<h2 id="ideas-first-or-data-first">Ideas first or data first</h2>
<p><img data-src="https://wulc.me/imgs/data_first_vs_idea_first.png" height="50%" width="50%"></p>
<p>The author favors the ideas first method. This usually results in
intuitive, simpler and more transparent rules. In the author's
experience, consistently profitable trading comes out of careful
research, done by thoughtful and knowledgeable people, who seek to
understand where their profits come from.</p>
<p>But some situations the data first process could be better; for
example in high frequency trading where there is plenty of data, rules
can be refitted regularly and novel ideas are more likely to be found as
market structure evolves.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-trading-rule">What makes a good trading
rule</h2>
<p>This book identifies the following four aspects as the most
crucial:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>explainable profits</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With an ideas first approach you can easily explain why a strategy
was profitable, since the explanation is inherent in the original idea.
For example you might have tested a trend following rule, which you
think makes money because of cognitive biases explained by prospect
theory.</p>
<p>With data first any explanation has to follow the fitting process.
You first examine how a rule behaves and then infer what might be
causing the effect. The more complex a data driven trading rule is the
harder it will be to explain.</p>
<p>Remember the narrative fallacy, another cognitive bias: humans like
stories. To trust a trading rule the author both a good story and a
rigorous back-test.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>intuitively understandable behaviour</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A complicated system might buy or sell when prices moved higher,
depending on the exact pattern. This would make its behaviour less
obvious and more unpredictable.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>as simple as possible</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is much easier to explain the profitability and behaviour of
simple trading rules, those with few moving parts and no weird
interactions.</p>
<p>Ideas first rules should be simple unless you begin with a very
convoluted idea, or over complicate it to get a more profitable
back-test, neither of which is recommended. Data first rules can be very
simple or extremely complicated, depending on how many parameters are
fitted. A data first rule with more parameters will be less explainable,
and more vulnerable to over-fitting.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>can be systematised</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Ideas need to translated into systematised rules. Not all styles of
trading are entirely suitable for this, because they are inherently
<strong>subjective</strong> or because of <strong>data
limitations</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>subjective</li>
</ul>
<p>Many methods of trading cannot be systematised because it’s
impossible to write down a set of relatively simple, objective and
generic rules. One example would be merger arbitrage, where you have to
assess the likelihood of a deal going through based on analysis of a
number of hard to quantify factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>data limitations</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if a strategy is objective the necessary data might be
unavailable. Even if you could write trading rules for merger arbitrage
the necessary information about legal and regulatory issues cannot
easily be converted into an algorithm friendly format.</p>
<p>There might also be a shortage of data, cause many years of data are
needed to properly test a strategy.</p>
<h2 id="why-certain-rules-make-profit">Why certain rules make
profit</h2>
<p>This book lists multiple cases to explain why certain rules are
profitable</p>
<ul>

<li><p><strong>risk premia</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are three types risk premia mentioned in this book</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>persistent risk premium</li>
</ol>
<p>Some risk premia persist for long periods, like the extra return
you’d expect from investing in equities versus safer assets like
bonds.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>timing varying risk premium</li>
</ol>
<p>You can make profits buying cheap premia and selling expensive ones.
This is a form of mean reversion trading, where you assume premia, and
hence prices, will revert to some long- term equilibrium.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>skew and unlikely events premium</li>
</ol>
<p>The rational investor of classical financial theory only cares about
an asset’s Sharpe ratio (SR) – it’s average returns adjusted for their
standard deviation.(Formally it is the mean return for a particular time
period divided by the standard deviation of returns for the same time
period; daily v.s annual)</p>
<p>This only makes sense if all assets have symmetrically distributed
returns.in practice assets with the same SR could make steady losses
with occasional large returns or steady gains with occasional large
losses</p>
<ul>
<li>positive skew VS negative skew</li>
</ul>
<p>When an asset has a higher chance of a large down move than an
equivalent up move, it is said to have a negative skew. If large up
moves are more likely then it has positive skew.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://wulc.me/imgs/positive_skew_vs_negative_skew.png" height="50%" width="50%"></p>
<p>With the same Sharpe ratio, the returns from a positively skewed
asset will contain more losing days than for those of a negatively
skewed asset. But the losing days will be relatively small in
magnitude.</p>
<p>Equities normally have mildly negative skew. ‘Safe haven’ assets like
gold and Swiss francs tend to have positive skew.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>liquidity and size</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The degree of liquidity in an asset is how easily we can buy or sell
without unduly affecting the price.</p>
<p>The premia for liquidity, size and leverage can vary over time,
presenting opportunities for well timed buying and selling.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>when others have to trade</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Not everyone trades because they are trying to make money. Some are
forced to.</p>
<p>A foreign exchange carry trading rule that borrows in low interest
rate currencies like Switzerland and invests in high interest rate
currencies will be consistently profitable as a result, at least until
the currency policy is abandoned</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>barriers to entry, returns to effort and cost</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some trading rules have barriers to entry in the form of costs or
investments that need to be made to realise profits from them. High
frequency strategies require renting expensive servers located
physically within exchange buildings, as well as developing specialised
software.</p>
<p>If an opportunity requires a lot of work to exploit, then it may be
passed up by most investors and additional returns would not be
available.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>behavioural effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can create rules which extract returns from other people’s
behavioural weaknesses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pure alpha and skill</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Those who exhibit pure skill can adapt to changing market
opportunities in a way that a systematic rule never could. If you think
you are part of this elite group then the semi- automatic trader example
is for you.</p>
<h2 id="trading-styles">Trading styles</h2>
<h3 id="static-vs-dynamic">static vs dynamic</h3>
<p>Static means you invest your portfolio and then do nothing, while
dynamic is to rebalance your protfolio the from time to time</p>
<p>The most intuitive dynamic rule is to re-balance your portfolio so
you keep the same cash value in each company.</p>
<p>Yet another rebalance rule is to equal risk instead of equal cash
value, which is <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-parity.asp">risk parity
investing</a>. This method assumes risk is equal to the recent standard
deviation of the daily percentage changes in price for each firm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Risk parity is an advanced portfolio technique often used by hedge
funds and sophisticated investors. It requires a complex quantitative
methodology, which makes its allocations more advanced than simplified
allocation strategies. <strong>The goal of risk parity investing is to
earn the optimal level of return at the targeted risk
level</strong>.</p>
<p>Simplified allocation strategies such as the 60%/40% stocks-bonds
portfolio make use of MPT. MPT provides a standard for diversification
within one's investment portfolio that maximizes expected return for a
given level of risk. In simplified MPT strategies using just stocks and
bonds, allocations are usually more heavily weighted toward equities for
investors who wish to take on more risk. Risk-averse investors will
instead have a higher weight in bonds for capital preservation.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>predictable risk vs unpredictable risk</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s very hard to forecast what the return will be each day over the
next few weeks for an asset or portfolio. But you can model and estimate
what the variation in returns is likely to be. Estimates based entirely
on assuming that recent levels of variation will persist tend to be
relatively good</p>
<h3 id="skew-positive-vs-negative">skew: positive vs negative</h3>
<p>The term "skew" mentioned here, just like the "skew" referred to in
the context of risk premium earlier, which usually can be classified
into positive skew and negative skew</p>
<p>If you are using a systematic trading rule and have access to
back-testing technology you can measure your skew. Otherwise you will
need to make a judgment on what it is likely to be based on your trading
style.</p>
<p>The characteristic of positive skew and nagative can be listed as
follows</p>
<p><img data-src="https://wulc.me/imgs/positiveSkew_vs_nagativeSkew.jpg" height="50%" width="50%"></p>
<p>Some examples of positive skew and negative skew</p>
<p><img data-src="https://wulc.me/imgs/positiveSkew_vs_nagativeSkew_example.jpg" height="50%" width="50%"></p>
<p>Be aware that if you are making steady profits nearly every day, and
most of your trades are winners, then there is a good chance you are
engaged in negative skew trading. It’s just that you haven’t yet seen
any rare large losses.</p>
<h3 id="trading-speed-fast-vs-slow">trading speed: fast vs slow</h3>
<p>Trading speed can be roughly classified into three types: very slow,
medium and fast, depends on the average holding period</p>
<p>Very slow systems usually hold assets for <strong>several months to
many years</strong>. While the average holding period of medium is
usually <strong>a few hours or days, to several months</strong>. But for
fast system, the holding period is usually <strong>microseconds to one
day</strong></p>
<p>Very slow systems look almost like static portfolios, with additional
gradual changes in position coming from their trading rules. Rules often
involve mean reversion to very long run equilibrium such as relative
value equity portfolios that buy past losers, and sell recent
winners.</p>
<p>In medium systems, trading costs need to be accurately measured to
decide whether an instrument should be traded at a faster or slower
speed within this region. Large institutional traders also need to
determine if a market has the capacity to absorb their trading. These
subjects will be covered in chapter twelve, ‘Speed and Size’.</p>
<p>For fast system, typical raw Sharpe ratios could be very high due to
the number of trades made, but costs will chew up a big chunk of
profits. Special execution algorithms are needed to reduce costs below
normal levels. There are higher barriers to entry than at slower speeds;
co-located servers and fully automated software is needed. Also faster
strategies are likely to have limited capacity. The domain of high
frequency trading mostly falls outside the scope of this book.</p>
<ul>
<li>LAW OF ACTIVE MANAGEMENT</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a law called <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/sell-side/capital-markets/fundamental-law-of-active-management/">LAW
OF ACTIVE MANAGEMENT</a>, which states that the <strong>Sharpe ratio of
a trading strategy will be proportional to the square root of the number
of independent bets made per year</strong>.</p>
<p>This law gives us some idea of how profits should vary with trading
speed. Suppose you’re holding one asset at a time, and making one ‘bet’
per year (buying, holding for 12 months before selling, then repeating),
and that you expect an SR of 0.15 from this activity.</p>
<p>If you decide to make four ‘bets’ a year, holding the asset for three
months, then because 2 is the square root of 4 you should expect an SR
of 2 × 0.15 = 0.30.</p>
<p>If you begin betting every single business day, then with around 256
business days in a year the SR will be 16 times larger than 0.15 or
2.4</p>
<p>The other important implication of the law is that diversification
across assets can substantially improve returns. If you can find four
assets which have zero correlation then you can double your Sharpe
ratio.</p>
<p>But the flaws of this law is also obvious, it assumes that the
‘skill’ of the trader is constant across holding periods (but the skills
required to day trade are very different from those a long-term investor
needs). It also ignores transaction costs；these can seriously damage
the returns of fast traders<br />
### technical vs fundamental</p>
<p>Strategies vary in the source of data they use, either using
technical or fundamental information, or both.</p>
<p>Purely technical rules only use <strong>price data</strong>. While
fundamental data, comes in two main flavours: <strong>micro and
macro</strong>. Micro data is about a specific asset, for example the
yield of a particular bond or the PE ratio of a company. Macro data such
as inflation and GDP growth covers entire economies.</p>
<p>Technical systems are easier to build and run, but in another example
of barriers to entry the additional effort required for including
fundamental rules is usually rewarded with higher returns. The examples
in this book are all technical</p>
<h3 id="portfolio-sizep">portfolio sizep</h3>
<p>As the law of active management shows that diversification is the
best source of additional risk adjusted returns. Both traders and
investors should hold more positions when they can; ideally across
several asset classes to get the greatest possible benefit. With larger
portfolios you’re also less exposed to instrument specific problems such
as bad data or temporary liquidity issues.</p>
<p>However smaller portfolios make sense for semi-automatic traders or
for those running entirely manual systems. In chapter twelve, ‘Speed and
Size’, those with relatively small accounts also have to limit the
number of positions they take.</p>
<h3 id="leverage-more-risk-and-yet-more-skew">leverage: more risk and
yet more skew</h3>
<p>Leverage is borrowing to invest or trade. The borrowing can be
explicit as when trading equities on margin, or implicit as with
derivatives like futures. Usually one needs leverage when the natural
return and risk of an asset is less than desired.</p>
<p>For example, if you want a 10% return on average, and your asset is a
bond with an expected Sharpe ratio of 0.5, but only a 5% annualised
standard deviation, then you need to lever up four times</p>
<p>Leverage can be dangerous, especially for negative skew, where we
gain small consistent gains until the trade goes terribly wrong. These
steady gains tricked you into thinking that the position was low risk,
and lured you into using leverage to improve your returns. So be aware
of gearing up on apparently low risk with an asset or with a style of
trading which is likely to have negative skew, even if you haven’t yet
seen any evidence of the large downside</p>
<h3 id="contrarians-market-followers-and-crowded-trades">contrarians,
market followers and crowded trades</h3>
<p>Three types of trades: contrarians, market followers and crowded
trades</p>
<p>Mean reversion and relative value traders act as contrarians, they
seek to take advantage of mis-pricing which means buying low after falls
and selling when the price has risen. Contrarian traders like to catch
falling knives.</p>
<p>Market followers usually prefer various forms of trend following.
Trend followers will close positions that have started to lose money,
like the early loss taker trading rule.</p>
<p>When the majority of market participants have the same bet on, which
could be from behaving as contrarians or market followers.As the story
goes when the shoeshine boy or the taxi driver is in the market, it’s
time to get out, cause the market if full of<br />
crowded trades.</p>
<h2 id="achievable-sharpe-ratios">Achievable Sharpe ratios</h2>
<p>It’s important to have a realistic sense of what level of Sharpe
ratios (SR) are achievable. Inflated expectations can lead to over
betting, which will be discussed more in chapter nine, ‘Volatility
Targeting’ and overtrading</p>
<p>The simplest possible risky investments, is a long only equity
position in one company, excess equity returns on single equities will
probably average around 3% a year in the future; with annualised
standard deviation of around 20%, this implies an SR of 3% ÷ 20% =
<strong>0.15</strong> is realistic</p>
<p>With the law of active management, investing in a portfolio of
equities will do slightly better. If you invest globally across multiple
countries you can probably get to a Sharpe ratio of around
<strong>0.25</strong></p>
<p>To do much better you’d need to allocate across multiple asset
classes: equities, bonds, commodities and so on. Since correlations
between asset classes are usually low, a portfolio covering several of
these types of assets can probably expect to reach a Sharpe ratio of
around <strong>0.40</strong></p>
<p>Many traders have highly unrealistic expectations of back-tested
Sharpe ratios of 2.0, 3.0 or even higher; just on single instruments!
These values are far too optimistic and are caused by over-fitting.
<strong>In reality SR consistently greater than 1.0 are rarely
achieved</strong>, even by sophisticated institutional investors.</p>
<p><strong>Usually there are two ways to increase SR, (1) trade negative
skew strategies (2) trade more quickly</strong></p>
<p>Howerever, taking into account the cost of each trading, trading more
quickly may not lead to high SR, as show in the image below</p>
<p><img data-src="https://wulc.me/imgs/trading_fast.png" height="50%" width="50%"></p>
<h1 id="conslusion">Conslusion</h1>
<p>This passage roughly talks about how to avoid flawd human brain with
systematic trading rules, which empahsizes why we need trading rules,
and how to measure whether rules are good or not. Different types of
traders and trading styles are also introduced in this passage, showing
those various factors that will affect your profits</p>
<p>It’s important that you understand and can cope with the risks of
your trading system. Finding the best trading rules is less important
than designing your trading system in the correct way. A balanced
combination of trading rules, with different styles that work in
different environments, is better than any single alternative.</p>
