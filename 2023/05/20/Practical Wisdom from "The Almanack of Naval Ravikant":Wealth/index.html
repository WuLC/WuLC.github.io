        <p>"<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.navalmanack.com/">The Almanack of Naval
Ravikant</a>" is a book that compiles the wisdom and insights of
entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant. This book mainly talks about
two topics, wealth and happiness. It offers practical advice on how to
live a more fulfilling and purposeful life.</p>
<p>Through his own experiences and perspectives, Naval provides readers
with valuable insights into topics like success, motivation, and
personal growth, making the book a useful guide for anyone looking to
improve their life and achieve their goals</p>
<p>I have benefited greatly from reading this book, and I want to write
some important takeaways from this book. As this book was written in
English, I want to give it a try to write it in English, too. too.
Hoping the passage will be beneficial to you, this passage is about the
first topic: <strong>Wealth</strong></p>
<span id="more"></span>
<h2 id="wealth">Wealth</h2>
<p>We have been pursuing wealth almost all our lives, and financial
freedom seems to be the ultimate goal of everyone</p>
<p>But firstly，what's the definition of wealth? The book gives the
definition of wealth as follows</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is <strong>assets that earn while you sleep</strong>.</p>
<p>Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things. Wealth is the
computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers.
Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other
assets, and into other businesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should purse wealth, not money or status. Because money is how we
transfer time and wealth, and status is your place in the social
hierarchy.</p>
<p>You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet
know how to get at scale.</p>
<p>So the following will focus on some of the key factors and abilities
the author believes are necessary to achieve financial freedom</p>
<h3 id="equity">Equity</h3>
<p><strong>You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must
own equity</strong>—a piece of a business to gain your financial
freedom.</p>
<p>If you are paid for renting out your time, you can make some money,
but you’re not going to make the money that gives you financial freedom.
You’re not going to have passive income where a business is earning for
you while you are on vacation.</p>
<p>Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of
<strong>a product, a business, or some IP</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in
a business</strong>. You could own equity as a small shareholder where
you bought stock, or stock options if you work at a tech company. You
could also own it as an owner where you started the company.</p>
<p>But usually, the real wealth is created by <strong>starting your own
companies or even by investing</strong>. In an investment firm, they’re
buying equity. These are the routes to wealth. It doesn’t come through
the hours.</p>
<h3 id="specific-knowledge">Specific Knowledge</h3>
<p>Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society
can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.</p>
<p>The specific knowledge is sort of this weird combination of unique
traits from your DNA, your unique upbringing, and your response to it.
It’s almost baked into <strong>your personality and your
identity</strong>. It is found much more by pursuing your innate
talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It’s not by going to
school for whatever is the hottest job; it’s not by going into whatever
field investors say is the hottest.</p>
<p>Some specific knowledge listed in the book are as follows</p>
<p><img data-src="https://wulc.me/imgs/SpecificKnowledge.jpg" height="50%" width="50%" alt="specific knowledge"></p>
<p>With all the specific knowledge above, we will focus on the
<strong>sales skills</strong>.</p>
<p>If someone is a natural at sales, obviously they learned somewhere,
but they didn’t learn it in a classroom setting. They learned probably
in their childhood in the school yard, or they learned negotiating with
their parents. Maybe some is a genetic component in the DNA</p>
<p>But you can improve sales skills. You can read Robert Cialdini, you
can go to a sales training seminar, you can do door-to-door sales. It is
brutal but will train you very quickly. Specific knowledge cannot be
taught, but it can be learned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will
be unstoppable.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a
perpetual learner</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a
brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the
“right” thing a long time ago</p>
<h3 id="levarage">Levarage</h3>
<p>Archimedes once said, "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on
which to place it, and I shall move the world."</p>
<p>Fortunes also require leverage. <strong>Business leverage comes from
capital, labor, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code
and media)</strong>.</p>
<p>Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge
with accountability and show resulting good judgment. For example,
working is the most common way to do this</p>
<p>Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most
fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents,
but don’t waste your life chasing it.</p>
<p>I think we should always remember the leverage we can use</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital and labor are permissioned leverage</strong>.
Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone
is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.</li>
<li><strong>Code and media are permissionless leverage</strong>. They’re
the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media
that works for you while you sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is
<strong>the idea of products that have no marginal cost of
replication</strong>. This is the new form of leverage. This was only
invented in the last few hundred years. It started with the printing
press. It accelerated with broadcast media, and now it’s really blown up
with the internet and with coding. Now, you can multiply your efforts
without involving other humans and without needing money from other
humans.</p>
<p>Also, they are <strong>permissionless</strong>. They don’t require
somebody else’s permission for you to use them or succeed. For labor
leverage, somebody has to decide to follow you. For capital leverage,
somebody has to give you money to invest or to turn into a product.
Coding, writing books, recording podcasts, tweeting, YouTubing—these
kinds of things are permissionless.</p>
<p>The book offers two useful advice, which can be applied to most
people</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An army of robots is freely available—it’s just packed in data
centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.</li>
<li>If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and
podcasts.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="productize-yourself">Productize yourself</h3>
<p>"Productize" has leverage. "Yourself" has accountability."Productize"
has specific knowledge. "Yourself" also has specific knowledge in
there.</p>
<p>Society will pay you for creating things it wants. But society
doesn’t yet know how to create those things, because if it did, they
wouldn’t need you. They would already be stamped out.</p>
<p>So if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of
those things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how
to get but it will want and providing it is natural to you, within your
skill set, and within your capabilities.</p>
<p>Then, you have to figure out <strong>how to scale it because if you
only build one</strong>, that’s not enough. You’ve got to build
thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions, or billions of them so
everybody can have one</p>
<p>So I think we can keep asking the question: <strong>Am I productizing
it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with capital or with
code or with media?</strong></p>
<h4 id="long-term-game-and-compound-interest">Long-Term Game and
Compound Interest</h4>
<p>Compound interest is a very powerful concept. Compound interest
applies to more than just compounding capital.It can also be applied in
business relationships, reputation and individual people working
with.</p>
<p>Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth,
relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.</p>
<h4 id="prioritize-and-focus">Prioritize and Focus</h4>
<p><strong>Spend more time making the big decisions</strong>. There are
basically three really big decisions you make in your early life:
<strong>where you live, who you’re with, and what you do</strong>.</p>
<p>We spend very little time deciding which relationship to get into. We
spend so much time in a job, but we spend so little time deciding which
job to get into. Choosing what city to live in can almost completely
determine the trajectory of your life, but we spend so little time
trying to figure out what city to live in.</p>
<p>If you’re going to live in a city for ten years, if you’re going to
be in a job for five years, if you’re in a relationship for a decade,
you should be spending one to two years deciding these things. These are
highly dominating decisions. Those three decisions really matter.</p>
<h4 id="patient">Patient</h4>
<p>Everybody wants to get rich immediately, but the world is an
efficient place; immediate doesn’t work. You do have to put in the time.
You do have to put in the hours, and so I think you have to put yourself
in the position with the specific knowl- edge, with accountability, with
leverage, with the authentic skill set you have, to be the best in the
world at what you do.</p>
<p>You have to enjoy it and keep doing it, keep doing it, and keep doing
it. Don’t keep track, and don’t keep count because if you do, you will
run out of time.</p>
<h2 id="judgement">Judgement</h2>
<p>Hard work is important. Without hard work, you’ll develop neither
judgment nor leverage. But nowadays it is really overrated, how hard you
work matters a lot less in the modern economy.</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>judgment is underrated</strong>. The
direction you’re heading in matters more than how fast you move,
especially with leverage.</p>
<p>So how can we develop our judgment?</p>
<h3 id="think-clearly">Think Clearly</h3>
<p>Navel believes that “Clear thinker” is a better compliment than
“smart.”</p>
<p>This is a good point in the book, and I think it can be used in life
in any circunstances</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone is using a lot of fancy words and a lot of big concepts,
they probably don’t know what they’re talking about</p>
<p>I think the smartest people can explain things to a child. <strong>If
you can’t explain it to a child, then you don’t know it.</strong> It’s a
common saying and it’s very true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what "<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/">The Feynman Learning
Technique</a>" is about. The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers.
They understand the basics at a very, very fundamental level.</p>
<p>So we should <strong>understand the basics really well rather than
memorize all kinds of complicated concepts</strong> we can’t stitch
together and can’t rederive from the basics.</p>
<p>If you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them,
you’re lost. You’re just memorizing. And this is exactly what "<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle">First
principle</a>" is about</p>
<h3 id="see-reality">See Reality</h3>
<p>Make sure you’re dealing with reality when you’re making decisions,
to achive this, we need to see reality</p>
<p>One thing clouding us from being able to see reality is we have
<strong>preconceived notions</strong> of the way it should be, which
will stop us from seeing the truth.</p>
<p><strong>To see the truth, you have to get your ego out of the way
because your ego doesn’t want to face the truth</strong>. The smaller
you can make your ego, the less conditioned you can make your reactions,
the less desires you can have about the outcome you want, the easier it
will be to see the reality.</p>
<p>Our egos are constructed in our formative years—our first two
decades. They get constructed by our environment, our parents, society.
Then, we spend the rest of our life trying to make our ego happy, which
is exactly the reason that ego will stop you from seeing the true.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, one important thing is to be able to
<strong>uncondition yourself</strong>, to be able to take your habits
apart and say, “Okay, this is a habit I probably picked up when I was a
toddler trying to get my parent’s attention. Now I’ve reinforced it and
reinforced it, and I call it a part of my identity. <strong>Does it
still serve me? Does it make me happier? Does it make me healthier? Does
it make me accomplish whatever I set out to accomplish</strong>?”</p>
<p>To see reality, we also need to <strong>focus on data and
analysis</strong>, instead of feeling. Because what you feel tells you
nothing about the facts, it merely tells you something about your
estimate of the facts.</p>
<p>This book also gives another interesting advice about empty space</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s actually really important to have empty space. If you don’t have
a day or two every week in your calendar where you’re not always in
meetings, and you’re not always busy, then you’re not going to be able
to think.</p>
<p>I also encourage taking at least one day a week (preferably two,
because if you budget two, you’ll end up with one) where you just have
time to think.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="skills-of-decision-making-mental-models">Skills of
Decision-Making: Mental Models</h3>
<p>Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning
foundational skills.</p>
<p>This book emphasizes that there is no skill called “business”. We
should void business magazines and business classes. Instead, study
microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics,
mathematics, and computers, which are the mental models the book
recommends.</p>
<p>Because during decision-making, the brain is a memory prediction
machine. A lousy way to do memory prediction is “X happened in the past,
therefore X will happen in the future.” It’s too based on specific
circumstances. What you want is principles. You want mental models.</p>
<p>Some mental models the book recommends and the key points of them are
as follows</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>evolution</strong>: a lot of modern society can be
explained through evolution</p></li>
<li><p><strong>inversion</strong>: being successful is just about
<strong>not making mistakes</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>complexity</strong> theory: the limits of our knowledge
and the limits of our prediction capability</p></li>
<li><p><strong>economics</strong>: understanding of
supply-and-demand</p></li>
<li><p><strong>principal-agent problem</strong>: if you want it done
right, then you have to go yourself and do it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>compound interest</strong>: in the intellectual domain,
compound interest rules</p></li>
<li><p><strong>basic math</strong>: arithmetic, probability, and
statistics</p></li>
<li><p><strong>balck swans</strong>: extreme probabilities</p></li>
<li><p><strong>calculus</strong>: measure the change in small discrete
or small continuous events</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IF YOU CAN’T DECIDE, THE ANSWER IS NO.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very rule in the book, when you're faced with a difficult
choice, such as: Should I marry this person? Should I take this job?
Should I buy this house? Should I move to this city?. etc</p>
<p>The reason listed in the book is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you cannot decide, the answer is no. And the reason is, modern
society is full of options. When you choose something, you get locked in
for a long time. Starting a business may take ten years. You start a
relationship that will be five years or maybe more. You move to a city
for ten to twenty years. These are very, very long-lived decisions. It’s
very, very important we only say yes when we are pretty certain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I doubt that a little, cause life is always full of uncertainty.
If we have to make decision when we are very certain, perhaps we can
make no decision. I prefer the quotes in the book "<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1624.West_with_the_Night">West
with the Night</a>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have learned that if you must leave a place that you have lived in
and loved and where all your yesteryears are buried deep, leave it any
way except a slow way, leave it the fastest way you can. Never turn back
and never believe that an hour you remember is a better hour because it
is dead. Passed years seem safe ones, vanquished ones, while the future
lives in a cloud, formidable from a distance.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>RUN UPHILL</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you have two choices to make, and they’re relatively equal
choices, <strong>take the path more difficult and more painful in the
short term</strong>.</p>
<p>What’s actually going on is one of these paths requires short-term
pain. And the other path leads to pain further out in the future. Your
brain is overvaluing the side with the short-term happi- ness and trying
to avoid the one with short-term pain.</p>
<p>So we have to cancel the tendency out (it’s a powerful subconscious
tendency) by leaning into the pain. As you know, most of the gains in
life come from suffering in the short term so you can get paid in the
long term</p>
<p>What are the most efficient ways to build new mental models?</p>
<p>Read a lot, just read. Reading science, math, and philosophy one hour
per day will likely put you at the upper echelon of human success within
seven years.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In summary, the first part of this book is about wealth, which mainly
talks about the definition of wealth and how to build wealth</p>
<p>All the methods mentioned in this book about building wealth can be
summarized into two words: <strong>Productize Yourself</strong></p>
<p>"Productize" has leverage. "Yourself" has accountability."Productize"
has specific knowledge. "Yourself" also has specific knowledge in there.
You need to figure out which one of those things you can provide for
society that it does not yet know how to get but it will want and
providing it is natural to you, within your skill set, and within your
capabilities. Then you have to figure out how to scale it</p>
<p>Another important point is about judgement, which is always
underrated compared to hard work.</p>
<p>To build judgement, we need to <strong>think clearly and see
reality</strong>, with some very useful mental models.</p>
