Trading: How to Build Your Own Algorithmic Trading Business</a>" by
Ernie Chan is a comprehensive guide that explores the world of
quantitative trading and provides practical advice for building a
algorithmic trading business, especially for individuals interested in
quantitative trading.</p>
<p>It covers essential concepts, methodologies, and practical tips to
help readers develop and implement their own algorithmic trading
strategies while effectively managing risk and building a sustainable
trading business.</p>
<p>Due to the significant benefits I received from reading this book, I
want to write down some of the most important takeways I get from this
book, with the hope that it can also be useful to you.</p>
<p>This passage is about the first four chapters, which introduce basic
requirements for independent traders, including search for ideas,
perform backtest, and what we need before doing actual trading.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>Quantitative trading, also known as algorithmic trading, is the
trading of securities based strictly on the buy/sell decisions of
computer algorithms.</p>
<p>It relies on advanced mathematical and statistical models, computer
algorithms, and data analysis to make trading decisions. It involves the
use of quantitative techniques to identify patterns, trends, and
opportunities in financial markets and execute trades automatically
without human intervention.</p>
<p>The quantitative trading this book focuses on is called
<strong>statistical arbitrage trading</strong>, which deals with the
simplest financial instruments: stocks, futures, and sometimes
currencies. The book argues that one does not need an advanced degree to
become a statistical arbitrage trader, compared to those institutional
quantitative traders who received their advanced degrees as physicists,
mathematicians, engineers, focusing on trading complex derivative
instruments</p>
<h2 id="independent-quantative-trading">Independent Quantative
Trading</h2>
<p>As this book is focus on independent quantitative traders, it lists
some demands for anyone who wants to venturing into this field, the most
important one I though is the following one</p>
<p>When one plunges into independent trading, fear of losses and of
being isolated from the rest of the world is natural, and so it helps to
have both a prior appreciation of risks and some savings to lean on. It
is important not to have a need for immediate profits to sustain your
daily living, as strategies have intrinsic rates of returns that cannot
be hurried</p>
<p><strong>The ideal independent quantitative trader is therefore
someone who has some prior experience with finance or computer
programming, who has enough savings to withstand the inevitable losses
and periods without income, and whose emotion has found the right
balance between fear and greed</strong>.</p>
<p>The book also talks about how much time to take for independent
quantative trading, since most people who enter this field aims for
freedom of wealth so as to have more time for their lives.And it depends
very much on the degree of automation you have achieved. The author
lists himself as an example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The largest block of time I need to spend is in the morning before
the market opens: I typically need to run various programs to download
and process the latest historical data, read company news that comes up
on my alert screen, run programs to generate the orders for the day, and
then launch a few baskets of orders before the market opens and start a
program that will launch orders automatically throughout the day. I
would also update my spreadsheet to record the previous day’s profit and
loss (P&amp;L) of the different strategies I run based on the
brokerages’ statements. All of this takes about two hours.</p>
<p>But the two hours reffered above is just the operational side of the
business. If you want to grow your business, or keep your current
profits from declining due to increasing competition, you will need to
spend time doing research and backtesting on new strategies. But
research and development of new strategies is the creative part of any
business, and it can be done whenever you want to. And this may take a
lot of time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are convinced that you want to become a quantitative trader, a
number of questions immediately follow, which will be answered in the
following chapters</p>
<p>（1）How do you find the right strategy to trade? （2）How do you
recognize a good versus a bad strategy even before devoting any time to
backtesting them? （3）How do you rigorously backtest them? （4）If the
backtest performance is good, what steps do you need to take to
implement the strategy, in terms of both the business structure and the
technological infrastructure? （5）If the strategy is profitable in
initial real-life trading, how does one scale up the capital to make it
into a growing income stream while managing the inevitable losses that
come with trading?</p>
<h2 id="fishing-for-ideas">Fishing for Ideas</h2>
<p>This part mainly answers the first question, How do you find the
right strategy？</p>
<p>Finding a strategy is not hard, there are hundreds, if not thousands,
of trading ideas that are in the public sphere at any time, accessible
to anyone at little or no cost. But they may not be useful, especially
for academics</p>
<p>The author states in the book that he had found that many strategies
described by academics are either too complicated, out of date (perhaps
the once-profitable strategies have already lost their power due to
competition), or require expensive data to backtest (such as historical
fundamental data). Furthermore, many of these academic strategies work
only on <strong>small-cap stocks, whose illiquidity may render actual
trading profits far less impressive than their backtests would
suggest</strong>.</p>
<p>However, numerous publicly accessible strategies may not be highly
rigorous, but one can consider making slight adjustments to these
strategies to achieve profitability. For example, the strategies from
traders’ forums may have worked only for a little while, or they work
for only a certain class of stocks, or they work only if you don’t
factor in transaction costs. However, the trick is that you can often
modify the basic strategy and make it profitable</p>
<h3 id="capital-matters">Capital Matters</h3>
<p>There are many factors to consider to get the most suitable strategy
for you, including working hours, programming skills, trading capital,
etc. Here we jsut focus on the factor of capital. Because capital
availability affects many choices</p>
<ul>
<li>account</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is whether you should open a retail brokerage account or a
proprietary trading account, which will be explained with more details
in chapter 4</p>
<ul>
<li>leverage</li>
</ul>
<p>With a <strong>low-capital account</strong>, we need to find
strategies that can utilize the <strong>maximum leverage</strong>
available. Trading futures, currencies, and options can offer you higher
leverage than stocks; intraday positions allow a Regulation T leverage
of 4, while interday (overnight) positions allow only a leverage of
2</p>
<p>Capital (or leverage) availability determines whether you should
focus on directional trades (long or short only) or dollar-neutral
trades (hedged or pair trades).</p>
<p>A <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/23187/dollar-neutral-strategy">dollar-neutral
trades</a> means that hold equal dollar amounts of long and short
positions, sometimes it’s also called market neutral strategies, and
<strong>a dollar-neutral portfolio or market-neutral portfolio requires
twice the capital or leverage of a long or short-only
portfolio.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>Capital availability also imposes a number of indirect constraints.
It affects how much you can spend on various infrastructure, data, and
software.</p>
<p>For example, if you have low trading capital, your online brokerage
will not be likely to supply you with real-time market data for too many
stocks, so you can’t really have a strategy that requires real-time
market data over a large universe of stocks.</p>
<p>Similarly, clean historical stock data with high frequency costs more
than historical daily stock data. And historical stock data without
survivorship bias are much more expensive than those that have such a
bias. Yet if your data have survivorship bias, the backtest result can
be unreliable.</p>
<ul>
<li>holding period</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a misconception aired by some investment advisers, that is
if your goal is to achieve maximum long-term capital growth, then the
best strategy is a buy-and-hold one. This notion has been shown to be
mathematically false.</p>
<p>In reality, maximum long-term growth is achieved by finding a
strategy with the maximum Sharpe ratio (defined in the next section),
provided that you have access to sufficiently high leverage. Therefore,
<strong>comparing a short-term strategy with a very short holding
period, small annual return, but very high Sharpe ratio, to a long-term
strategy with a long holding period, high annual return, but lower
Sharpe ratio, it is still preferable to choose the short-term strategy
even if your goal is long-term growth</strong>, barring tax
considerations and the limitation on your margin borrowing (more on this
surprising fact later in Chapter 6 on money and risk management).</p>
<p>A long holding period does not guarantee a good strategy; however, in
many cases, it is really hard to judge the market trend correctly, which
leads to the truth that long-term approach is more profitable than

<blockquote>
<p>I started my life as an independent quantitative trader with $100,000
at a retail brokerage account (I chose Interactive Brokers), and I
traded only directional, intraday stock strategies at first. But when I
developed a strategy that sometimes requires much more leverage in order
to be profitable, I signed up as a member of a proprietary trading firm
as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="before-backtesting">Before Backtesting</h3>
<p>Even before doing an in-depth backtest of the strategy, you can
quickly filter out some unsuitable strategies if they fail one or more
of these tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it outperform a benchmark?</li>
<li>Does it have a high enough <strong><a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio">Sharpe
ratio</a></strong>?</li>
<li>Does it have a <strong>small enough drawdown and short enough
drawdown duration</strong>?</li>
<li>Does the backtest suffer from <strong>survivorship
bias</strong>?</li>
<li>Does the strategy lose steam in recent years compared to its earlier
years?</li>
<li>Does the strategy have its own “niche” that protects it from intense
competition from large institutional money managers?</li>
</ul>
<p>We will talk about the above questions one by one</p>
<ul>
<li>benchmark</li>
</ul>
<p>To compare strategy with a benchmark is important, but we also need
to realize that different assets require different benchmarks</p>
<p>Everybody seems to know that if a long-only strategy returns 10
percent a year, it is not too fantastic because investing in an index
fund will generate as much, if not better, return on average. However,
if the strategy is a long-short dollar-neutral strategy (i.e., the
portfolio holds long and short positions with equal capital), then 10
percent is quite a good return, because then the benchmark of comparison
is not the market index, but a riskless asset such as the yield of the
three-month U.S. Treasury bill (which at the time of this writing is
about 4 percent).</p>
<p>And Excess Returns = Portfolio Returns − Benchmark Returns</p>
<ul>
<li>sharpe ratio and drawdown</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't just consider the return rate, Sharpe ratio is also
important</p>
<p>There is often a trade-off between the return rate and the sharpe
ratio; however, the book suggests that higher Sharpe ratio often leads
to higher returns because leverage can be applied to benefit, and the
partial risk of leverage can be hedged by the high Sharpe ratio.</p>
<p>If a strategy has deep (e.g., more than 10 percent) or lengthy (e.g.,
four or more months) drawdowns, it is unlikely that it will have a high
Sharpe ratio</p>
<p>Any strategy with a Sharpe ratio less than 1 is not considered a good
strategy, and strategies that are profitable every day typically have a
Sharpe ratio greater than 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>steam and transaction costs</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to commission fees, there are also costs incurred due to
liquidity; for example, the inability to sell at a specific price or the
price drop after selling.</p>
<p>The book explains this point with the following example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when you buy or sell a large chunk of securities, you will not be
able to complete the transaction without impacting the prices at which
this transaction is done. This effect on the market prices due to your
own order is called market impact, and it can contribute to a large part
of the total transaction cost when the security is not very liquid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term "slippage" is used to describe the situation mentioned
above, slippage is the difference between the price that triggers the
order and the execution price. Of course, this slippage can be of either
sign, but <strong>on average it will be a cost rather than a gain to the
trader</strong></p>
<p><strong>Taking transaction costs into account, the Sharpe ratio of a
strategy may shift from positive to negative.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>data</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually there are two problems related to data, surviveship bias and
regime shifts</p>
<p>Survivorship bias in data refers to the exclusion of assets that have
already delisted or disappeared from the backtesting data.</p>
<p>Some strategies are significantly impacted by this bias, such as
those specifically focus on buying cheap stocks. These strategies may
not be targeting undervalued assets, but rather assets that are on the
verge of delisting or disappearing.</p>
<p>As to "regime shifts" in the financial markets, it means that
financial data from an earlier period simply cannot be fitted to the
same model that is applicable today</p>
<p>This point may be hard to swallow for many statistically minded
readers. Many of them may think that the more data there is, the more
statistically robust the backtest should be. This is true only when the
financial time series is generated by a stationary process.
Unfortunately, <strong>financial time series is famously
nonstationary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>fly under the Radar</li>
</ul>
<p>For personal traders, avoid blindly following strategies of
superstitious large institutions; instead, find a well-considered and
independent strategy that suits you, or "strategy fly under the
Radar"</p>
<p>You should look for those strategies that fly under the radar of most
institutional investors, for example, strategies that have very low
capacities because they trade too often, strategies that trade very few
stocks every day, or strategies that have very infrequent positions</p>
<h2 id="backtesting">Backtesting</h2>
<p>There are many nuts and bolts involved in creating a realistic
historical backtest and in reducing the divergence of the future
performance of the strategy from its backtest performance.</p>
<p>Issues discussed here include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data: <strong>Split/dividend adjustments, noise in daily
high/low</strong>, and survivorship bias.</li>
<li>Performance measurement: Annualized Sharpe ratio and maximum
drawdown.</li>
<li>Look-ahead bias: Using unobtainable future information for past
trading decisions.</li>
<li>Data-snooping bias: Using too many parameters to fit historical
data, and avoiding it using large enough sample, out-of-sample testing,
and sensitivity analysis.</li>
<li>Strategy refinement: Common ways to make small variations on the
strategy to optimize performance.</li>
<li>Transaction cost: Impact of transaction costs on performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>There are serveral aspects to which we need to pay attention when
dealing with data in backtesting</p>
<ul>
<li>Dividend and Split</li>
</ul>
<p>In the financial field, a dividend refers to a portion of a company's
profits distributed to its shareholders. When a company makes a profit,
it can choose to return a portion of the earnings to its shareholders in
the form of cash or stock. This is known as a dividend payment. There
are two main types of dividends:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Cash Dividend: A dividend paid by the company directly in the form
of cash to its shareholders.</li>
<li>Stock Dividend: An extra share of stock distributed to shareholders
in the form of additional shares.</li>
</ol>
<p>As to split, a stock split refers to a company dividing its existing
shares into a larger number of shares at a certain ratio, thereby
increasing the number of shares while reducing the price per share. For
example, a 2-for-1 stock split means each share is split into two
shares, but the price per share is reduced by half. Stock splits do not
change the market value of the company or the total equity of
shareholders.</p>
<p>The viewpoint of this book is that we need to refresh the price of
the stock when there is dividen or split, according the the exact number
of dividen or split</p>
<ul>
<li>High and Low Data</li>
</ul>
<p>A backtest that relies on high and low data is less reliable than one
that relies on the open and close.</p>
<p>After retrieving the data from a database, it is often advisable to
do a quick error check. The simplest way to do this is to
<strong>calculate the daily returns based on the data</strong>. If you
have open, high, low, and close prices, you can calculate the various
combinations of daily returns such as from the previous high to today’s
close as well. You can then examine closely those days with returns that
are, say, 4 standard deviations away from the average.Typically, an
extreme return should be accompanied by a news announcement, or should
occur on a day when the market index also experienced extreme returns.
If not, then your data is suspect</p>
<ul>
<li>Survivorship Bias</li>
</ul>
<p>One way to overcome this problem is to start collecting point-in-time
data yourself for the benefit of your future backtest. If you save the
prices each day of all the stocks in your universe to a file, then you
will have a point-in-time or survivorship-bias-free database to use in
the future. Another way to lessen the impact of survivorship bias is to
backtest your strategies on more recent data so that the results are not
distorted by too many missing stocks.</p>
<h3 id="performance-measurement">Performance measurement</h3>
<p>The point in this book is that <strong>sharpe ratio and
drawdowns</strong> are the two most important measurements in
backtesting.</p>
<p>But usually it did not include average annualized returns, the
measure most commonly quoted by investors. The reason in the book is if
you use this measure, you have to tell people a number of things about
what denominator you use to calculate returns.</p>
<p>In general, if you calculate your average and standard deviation of
returns based on a certain trading period T, whether T is a month, a
day, or an hour, and you want to annualize these quantities, you have to
first find out how many such trading periods there are in a year (call
it NT). Then <strong>Annualized Sharpe Ratio = (NT) × Sharpe
Ratio</strong></p>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h3>
<p>These pitfalls are actually some common problems in machine
learning</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Look-Ahead Bias: same as the problem of data leakage in machine
learning</p></li>
<li><p>Data-Snooping Bias: same as the problem of overfitting in machine
learning, the author offers his experience as follows</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually, an erroneous backtest would produce a historical performance
that is better than what we would have obtained in actual trading</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a rule of thumb, I would not employ more than five parameters,
including quantities such as entry and exit thresholds, holding period,
or the lookback period, in computing moving averages.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that <strong>the number of data points needed for
optimizing your parameters is equal to 252 times the number of free
parameters your model has.(purely on experience.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity Analysis: to test if a strategy if robust</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you have optimized your parameters as well as various features
of your model and have verified that its performance on a test set is
still reasonable, vary these parameters or make some small qualitative
changes in the features of the model and see how the performance changes
on both the training and the test sets.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="transaction-costs">Transaction Costs</h3>
<p>In actual financial trading, there are various costs involved, like
commission, liquidity cost, opportunity cost, market impact, and
slippage, which we had reffered in the previous chapter</p>
<p>These costs can greatly impact the final returns in backtesting.And
it should not surprise you to find that a strategy with a high Sharpe
ratio before adding transaction costs can become very unprofitable after
adding such costs</p>
<p>So you should consider transaction costs in backtesting</p>
<h3 id="strategy-refinement">Strategy Refinement</h3>
<p>Usaually there are some very simple strategies that are fairly well
known in traders’ circles and are still somewhat profitable, though
their returns seem to be diminishing. An example is the pair trading of
stocks. <strong>The reason they are diminishing in returns is that too
many traders are taking advantage of this arbitrage opportunity and
gradually erasing the profit margin</strong>. However, it is often
possible to introduce minor variations in the basic strategy, which will
boost its returns.</p>
<p>These minor variations are often far less well known than the basic
strategy, and therefore far less well exploited by traders. Sometimes
they involve <strong>excluding certain stocks or groups of stocks from
the universe</strong>. For example, traders often prefer to exclude
pharmaceutical stocks from their technical trading program because of
the dramatic impact of news on their prices, or else they may exclude
stocks that have pending merger or acquisition deals. Other traders
<strong>change the entry and exit timing or frequency of the
trades</strong>. And <strong>a strategy that has a very good Sharpe
ratio when it is applied to small-cap stocks becomes very unprofitable
when applied to large-cap stocks</strong>.</p>
<p>When introducing these refinements to your strategy, <strong>it is
preferable that the refinement has some basis in fundamental economics
or a well-studied market phenomenon, rather than some arbitrary rule
based on trial and error</strong>. Otherwise, data-snooping bias
looms.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-your-business">Setting up your business</h2>
<h3 id="retail-or-proprietray">Retail or Proprietray</h3>
<p>Proprietary trading firms are financial companies specialized in
proprietary trading. This means they use their own capital for trading,
aiming to profit from market fluctuations. These firms typically have
highly specialized trading teams that employ complex trading strategies.
They use their own funds for trading, enabling them to seek profits in
high-risk, high-return markets.</p>
<p>Retail brokerage accounts are accounts opened by individual investors
with a brokerage or securities firm. Through retail brokerage accounts,
individual investors can buy and sell financial products such as stocks,
bonds, and funds. These accounts are typically geared towards the
general public and offer relatively simple investment options and
trading functionalities. The funds in these accounts come from the
individual investors themselves and are used to meet their personal
investment needs.</p>
<p>Their difference are listed as follows in this book</p>
<p><img data-src="https://wulc.me/imgs/Retail_versus_Proprietary.jpg" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Retail versus Proprietary"></p>
<p>In a nutshell, <strong>retail brokerages give you complete freedom
and better capital protection but smaller leverage</strong>, while
proprietary trading firms give you less freedom and less capital
protection but much high leverage. You can choose to have both retail
and proprietary accounts, each tailored to the specific needs of your
strategies</p>
<p>The decision whether to go retail or to join a proprietary trading
firm is generally based on your need of capital, the style of your
strategy, and your skill level.</p>
<p>For example, if you run a low-risk, market-neutral strategy that
nevertheless requires a much higher leverage than allowed by Regulation
T in order to generate good returns, a proprietary account may be better
for you. However, if you engage in high-frequency futures trading that
does not require too much capital, a retail account may save you a lot
of costs and hassles. Similarly, a very experienced trader with strong
risk man- agement practices and emotional stability probably doesn’t
need the guidance given by a proprietary firm, but less experienced
traders may benefit from the imposed restraints.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you have chosen to trade in a retail bro-
kerage or join a proprietary trading firm, you need to make sure their
trading account and systems have these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relatively <strong>low commissions</strong>.</li>
<li>Trade a <strong>good variety of financial instruments</strong>.</li>
<li>Access to <strong>deep pool of liquidity</strong>.</li>
<li>API for real-time data retrieval and order transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p>A "deep pool of liquidity" refers to a financial market or trading
environment where there is a significant volume of buy and sell orders
available for a particular asset (such as a stock, currency, or
commodity) at various price levels. In other words, it is a market with
a large number of participants willing to trade that particular asset,
resulting in a high level of trading activity.</p>
<h3 id="physical-infrastructure">Physical Infrastructure</h3>
<p>In quantitative trading, high-performance servers and reliable
network connections are critical because they directly affect the
efficiency of executing trading strategies and the stability of
trades.</p>
<p>Here are some aspects that need to be cosidered in this part</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Server Selection</strong>: Quantitative trading requires
the use of high-performance servers, typically servers with powerful
processing capabilities and large memory capacity. These servers need to
process market data rapidly, run complex trading strategies, and execute
trade instructions efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low Latency</strong>: The success of quantitative trading
often relies on quick execution and response times. Therefore, servers
need to have low latency characteristics to ensure that trade
instructions reach the exchange and receive a response as quickly as
possible, reducing the impact of network latency on trade
slippage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Redundant Systems</strong>: As quantitative trading
involves high-frequency, automated trading, server reliability is
crucial. Redundant systems, such as redundant power supplies, redundant
hard drives, and redundant network interfaces, are used to prevent
single points of failure and ensure the continuous operation of
servers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Server Location</strong>: Server location is also an
important consideration. To minimize trade execution latency, some
quantitative traders place servers in data centers close to the
exchange, reducing the transmission time of trade instructions as much
as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Connectivity</strong>: High-speed and stable
network connections are crucial for quantitative trading. Quantitative
traders often choose high-quality dedicated network connections or
leased lines to ensure fast and reliable data transmission.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security</strong>: Quantitative trading involves a
significant amount of trade data and sensitive information. Therefore,
servers and network infrastructure need to have robust security measures
to protect traders' data and funds.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The above requirements may seem too strict for the trading which
frequency is relatively lower, since it is usually for
ultra-high-frequency trading applications. But some infrastructure is
still required to support the development and execution of trading
strategies. For example, server, network ans security, and it highly
depends on what kind of trading you're performing.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In summary, this passage discusses various aspects of quantitative
trading and provides practical advice for building an algorithmic
trading business. It emphasizes the importance of strategy selection,
backtesting, and setting up the necessary infrastructure. Here are the
key points covered:</p>
<p><strong>Quantitative Trading Overview and Independent Quantitative
Trading</strong>: Quantitative trading, also known as algorithmic
trading, uses computer algorithms, mathematical models, and data
analysis to make buy/sell decisions automatically. The ideal independent
quantitative trader should have some prior experience in finance or
computer programming, sufficient savings to withstand losses, and
emotional balance between fear and greed.</p>
<p><strong>Finding Trading Ideas</strong>: Traders can find trading
strategies from various sources, but it is essential to verify and
refine them. Minor adjustments to existing strategies can lead to
profitable results. Factors Influencing Strategy Selection: Capital
availability, infrastructure, and holding period influence the choice of
trading strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Backtesting</strong>: Backtesting involves testing a
strategy's performance using historical data.Considerations include
dividend/split adjustments, data accuracy, perfromance measurements,
transaction costs, and sensitivity analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Setting Up Your Business</strong>: Traders can choose between
retail brokerage accounts and proprietary trading firms. Important
features to consider include low commissions, access to a variety of
financial instruments, deep liquidity, and real-time data retrieval and
order transmission. And traders also need for set up some physical
infrastructure for real trading.</p>
